This model is only for Train/Walk data, the model was trained on 12 datasets containing Train/Walk Accelarator information in X, Y and Z. 

# Bus/Train/Walk (k-NN Model)
This model is for Bus/Train/Walk data, the model was trained on 12 datasets containing Bus/Train/Walk Accelarator information in X, Y and Z. 

# Weng/Train/Walk (Random Forest)
This model is for Train/Walk data, model is trained on 11 datasets and then tested on the 12th dataset. Use Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer readings. More information can be found in README within the subfolder Weng:Train:Walk.
